* Greetings! :P This is `Shiyu Wu`, currently a software engineer at `Amazon Web Services` in Seattle area. My birth name in Chinese is `吴矢瑀`, meaning perseverance and jade.

* I work in `EC2 Networking` org, trying to solve questions like: how to make EC2 customer's access to AWS resources safer, faster, more reliable?

* I was born and raised in the suburb of `Shanghai`, speaking `Mandarin` and `Wu Chinese`.

* My life journey so far: `Shanghai` -> `Ann Arbor` -> `Austin` -> `Seattle` -> `?`.

* I am interested in `data-intensive systems`, `database`, `distributed systems` including `blockchain`, and related stuff.

* Other areas actively drawing my interests: `machine learning`, `finance`, `psychology`.

<!-- I spent my college time at `University of Texas at Austin`, `University of Michigan - Ann Arbor`, and `Shanghai Jiao Tong University`. -->

* `Hook 'em`, `Go Blue`, and `Admire the Elder`. : )
