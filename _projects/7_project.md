### Goal
Paperman is designed to automatically sort papers based on its usage over two sides.

### Contribution
Developed the algorithm on Arduino to control sensors and step motor for paper transmission and classification. Used CAD to draw 2D blueprints, 3D images, and concept diagrams. The machine had averaging 90 percent rate of correct sorting. The project won Best Technical Achievement Award in the design expo.
