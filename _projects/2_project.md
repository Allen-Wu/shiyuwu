### Paper
Zheming Zhou, Tianyang Pan, Shiyu Wu, Haonan Chang, Odest Chadwicke Jenkins, "GlassLoc: Plenoptic Grasp Pose Detection in Transparent Clutter" IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2019)

### Goal
Detect grasp poses of translucent objects or objects under transluceny clutter using plenoptic camera and learning methods.

### Contribution
Built the pipeline of incorporating Grasp Pose Generator (GPG) to extract grasp posesâ€™ features of translucent objects. Implemented data augmentation methods to generate training data. Collected light field images and point cloud training data. Migrated PointCNN for feature learning on depth likelihood volumes.
